    "In this interactive Python notebook, we will be going over the fundamentals of loops, particularly the `for` loop and the `while` loop. This notebook has been made and testing using **Python 3**. I believe Google Colab is currently on Python 3.10, which is different than the most recent version of Python (3.12), but those version differences should be irrelevant to this notebook and its contents.To use this notebook, simply download this file and upload to Google Colab! Next to each code block should be a play button which you can press to execute the code block. For this notebook, each code block can be run independently and in any order!"

    "The common problem with trying to loop through lists and strings people first run into is how do you know where the end of the list or string is? Let's say there is a list of lowercase letters called `letters`. How does *any* loop know where the end is? You can't exactly check if there is a next letter because you can get an error of trying to access an index out of bounds. A `while` loop requires a condition and a `for` loop requires a number or some sort of range, so how do we form the correct condition or `range`?\n",

    "To answer this problem, we must first need to know what information we know about this list. We know what variable it is tied to (`letters`), but that doesn't really help. We do know what is inside, but we need to access them all somehow. The last piece of info we do have is the *length* of the list with `len()`!\n",

    "we can note that the length of the list is one larger than the last index. If you think about it, generally speaking, *every* list has a length that is exactly one larger than the largest index (this is due to zero-indexing). But how is this helpful? We know now that all the indices in the list will range from 0 to `len()`-1. We can use `range()` to generate those numbers and use a `for` loop to go through each index one by one:"
